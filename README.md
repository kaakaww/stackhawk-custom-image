# HawkScan
StackHawk provides dynamic application vulnerability scanning from development to production.
- âš¡ Dynamic Application Scanning: Use HawkScan to find and fix security bugs in your web apps, before you push to production. Think of it as security integration testing. Get started with your first scan in minutes.

- ðŸ¦¸ Built for Modern Dev Teams: Automate scans with Docker commands, manage configs via YAML, and add app scanning as a build stage. We're built for dev teams that care about security and quality.

- ðŸ§° Vulnerability Management: Document for compliance. Prioritize and manage fixes with integrations to existing ticketing tools. Point in time assessments are a thing of the past - there is a better way.

# StackHawk Custom Image

* [Postman](https://github.com/kaakaww/stackhawk-custom-image/tree/main/postman-newman)
* [Cypress](https://github.com/kaakaww/stackhawk-custom-image/tree/main/integrations/cypress)
* [Playwright](https://github.com/kaakaww/stackhawk-custom-image/tree/main/integrations/playwright)
* [Selenium](https://github.com/kaakaww/stackhawk-custom-image/tree/main/integrations/selenium)
