# HawkScan
StackHawk provides dynamic application vulnerability scanning from development to production.
- âš¡ Dynamic Application Scanning: Use HawkScan to find and fix security bugs in your web apps, before you push to production. Think of it as security integration testing. Get started with your first scan in minutes.

- ðŸ¦¸ Built for Modern Dev Teams: Automate scans with Docker commands, manage configs via YAML, and add app scanning as a build stage. We're built for dev teams that care about security and quality.

- ðŸ§° Vulnerability Management: Document for compliance. Prioritize and manage fixes with integrations to existing ticketing tools. Point in time assessments are a thing of the past - there is a better way.

# StackHawk Custom Image

This is a repository with examples of HawkScan used with other common software development tools, aka _devtools_, to help users customize their on StackHawk Docker images. This repo provides instructions to use HawkScan with:

* [Postman](https://github.com/kaakaww/stackhawk-custom-image/tree/main/postman-newman)
* [Cypress](https://github.com/kaakaww/stackhawk-custom-image/tree/main/integrations/cypress)
* [Playwright](https://github.com/kaakaww/stackhawk-custom-image/tree/main/integrations/playwright)
* [Selenium](https://github.com/kaakaww/stackhawk-custom-image/tree/main/integrations/selenium)

This repo provides steps to create a custom docker image starting from stackhawk base image, and how to run it from a container. Typically a team may instead want to start from a different base image and add hawkscan as a third-party utility. See below for instructions.


## Run HawkScan in your container

Containers are commonly used to host applications in a Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CICD) pipeline. Running your containerized web application in a test environment will closely reflect how it will perform in production. Testing your web applications with HawkScan in the CICD pipeline will help teams ship secure software with confidence.

HawkScan is best implemented in the CICD pipeline, and testing your web application is much easier once your web application is containerized. A docker image includes instructions to copy your application code into the docker container and run it with required dependencies. Your docker container should include all software required to run and test your application. This includes:

* **Software Runtimes**: such as nodejs or java
* **build libraries:** such as gcc or gradle
* **runtime dependencies:** such as drivers or browsers
* **your application source code**

While this repo provides steps and examples to create a custom docker image _starting from the `stackhawk/hawkscan` base image_, typically a team will instead _add HawkScan to your application's docker image_. Here are the steps to accomplish that:

* Add the [StackHawk CLI](https://docs.stackhawk.com/stackhawk-cli/) to your base image with the following additions to your dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Update this value with your preferred version of HawkScan
ARG HAWKSCAN_VERSION="2.9.0"

# create a /hawk directory and download/unzip the version of HawkScan there
RUN mkdir /hawk curl -v https://download.stackhawk.com/hawk/cli/hawk-${HAWKSCAN_VERSION}.zip -o hawk-${HAWKSCAN_VERSION}.zip /hawk

# ... include your application content, runtime source, and stackhawk.yaml file

# start hawkscan from the scan shawk endpoint.
ENTRYPOINT ["hawk/shawk"]

```

* If HawkScan should to run alongside other third-party testing tools, be sure your StackHawk.yaml file is configured for [Custom Scan Discovery](https://docs.stackhawk.com/hawkscan/scan-discovery/custom.html) to run the other testing tools as configured. Pay attention to any requirements for running your web application with https if that is enabled when running your web application in the CICD pipeline.

* With new releases of HawkScan you can update the `HAWKSCAN_VERSION` for new scanner improvement capabilities.
